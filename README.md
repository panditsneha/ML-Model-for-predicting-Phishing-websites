# ML-Model-for-predicting-Phishing-websites
Building a model that predicts/classifies whether a website is a Phishing website.

## Approach ::
The selected approach is Random Forest Classifier because:
1. It has the highest accuracy (97.357724)
2. It has the Lowest error rate (2.642276)
3. It is a bagging(parallel) ensemble technique
4. It is useful for determining feature importance easily

## Tools and Techniques ::
The Random Forest Classifier uses Bagging Ensemble technique.
Ensemble technique is used for combining multiple models to obtain better results. Bagging is a parallel ensemble technique in which data are selected from the training set more than once i.e with replacement.

## Visualizations
Feature importance for tree based models are used, which tells the important features of the dataset.
